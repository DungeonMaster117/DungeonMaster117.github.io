	This week I created the base for my website! I am very excited for things to come.<br>

	I have done a few things this week. I created my person card, which goes from a t. rex skull to a living t. rex when you hover over it. I also created a basic menu for my homepage of my website. I wonder how my homepage will evolve going forward.

	I made a display of T Rex's size using JS. First, it uses a function that creates a new image of a person silhouette (the display measures the dinosaur in the unit of humans long). Then, the code uses a for loop. This creates a counter that starts at 0. Whenever the code creates a new human silhouette, it increases the counter by 1. However, it is programmed to only work while the counter is below 7. Thus, it only creates 7 silhouettes, instead of infinite.
